             <h3>What Is The Metaverse ?</h3>
             <p>
                A metaverse is a persistent online virtual environment that incorporates a broad range of Internet functions. In futurism, the term is often described as a hypothetical iteration of the Internet as a virtual world that is facilitated by the use of virtual and augmented reality headsets.

            <h3>How Metaverse will change the Internet ?</h3>
            <p>
                Mark Zuckerberg says the metaverse is not just the next chapter of his company Meta: it's the next chapter of the internet. The metaverse is meant to replace, or improve, real-life functionality in a virtual space. Things that users do in their day-to-day life, such as attending classes or going to work, can all be done in the metaverse instead.

            <h3>What is augmented reality ?</h3>
            <p>
                Augmented reality (AR) is an enhanced version of the real physical world that is achieved through the use of digital visual elements, sound, or other sensory stimuli delivered via technology. It is a growing trend among companies involved in mobile computing and business applications in particular.
